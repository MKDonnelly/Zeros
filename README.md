# ZerOS
The Zeros operating system, personally developed and designed by Matthew Donnelly.  
## About
This project spanned several months and involved the creation of an operating system capable of supporting a primitive userland with threading, multiprocessing, and system calls.  In the future, this code base will be used to explore the concept of a message-based operating system, whereby all communication between processes is abstracted as a message, including the interaction between a process and the kernel.
